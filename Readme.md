#Password Manager - PassMan

This is a Password manager that stores the passwords of a user . User need to sign up first with PassMan ID and a Master Password . After this the user can easily Enter the records , search the saved records and delete the saved records also .
The benifits of this software is that , the data is saved in encrypted form in the database .
I have used a SQLITE3 database here to store the data . But , No need to worry as If somehow any intruder open up the database ,then also the information will be of no use as the info is encrypted .
